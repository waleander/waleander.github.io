Some information about you!

### More Information

Some years back as a young kid in elementary school, my school had just procured a PC running on DOS, and Computer Studies was the new entrant into the school curriculla. My lightbulb encounter with the widget when we I was taught to code a script to store and retrieve my name in and out of the computer system. I became fascinated with computers from then on. I always looked forward to computer class period to run my script, and see my name appeared on the screen, It gave me a special feeling. 

Then as now, I'm intrigued by the limitless possibilities of not just writing codes but developing software applications that expands the limit of our world.
