I'm Akinwale Alexander, I'm a software developer.

### More Information

Some years back as a young kid in elementary school, my school had just procured a PC running on DOS, and Computer studies was the new entrant into the school curriculla. My lightbulb encounter with the widget came when I was taught to code a script that stored and retrieved my name from computer. I became fascinated with computers from then on. I always looked forward to the computer class just so I could run my script, and see my name appeared on the screen, It gave me a special feeling. 

Then as now, I'm intrigued by the limitless possibilities of not just writing codes but developing software applications that expands the limit of our world.
