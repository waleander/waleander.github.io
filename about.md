 HI! :open_hands: I'm **Akinwale 'Yele Alexander**. A software developer, teacher,. I blog about software development with a particular focus on **Scala** and its ecosystem (including but not limited to **Akka-stream**, **Play framework**, **Kafka**), and a dash of functional programming(**ZIO**, **Cats-Effect**). I have spent appreciable amount of time hacking and engineering software applications for a few companies in Nigeria. As a side hustle, I contribute to **open source** projects; work on personal projects, and connect with great people.
 
 I'm an avid fan of medieval epic fantasy novels in particular J.R.R Tolkien's Trilogy, The Lord of the Ring, and George R. R. Martin series, The Game of Thrones. It goes without saying that I love history and non-fiction history books as well.
 
  I'm a huge sports enthusiast, It wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary to catch me on a matchday supporting **Chelsea F.C.** while they run rings around **Liverpool**, or biking :mountain_biking_man: on the sand dunes of the **Namib desert**. I'm a **gamer**, I'm currently accepting challenges for **Playstation Pro Evolution Soccer** :soccer:, fancy your chances?, send :rocket: me your gauntlet [here](https://alexakinwale.com), you can be sure I would pick it up.
 
 I have gone from being a fan of **functional programming** to a reluctant adopter. My primary language is, but not limited to, **Scala**(I have written tons of codes in **Java**, **JavaScript** and **C#** as well). In my own opinion, it all boils down to great applications that are useful and commercially viable.

### My Motivation
I'm motivated by **fear**. No task is ever huge for me. I don't see myself as talented, I see myself as someone who excels at a ridiculously sickening work ethic. The separation of talent and skill is something that I always try to come to terms with. No matter how talented one is, skills is talent that has been trained. So I keep honing my skill, and I would rather people see it as talent than for the talent to atrophy or be misused.

### Social Nanoscaling

This is is the term I use to regain situation awareness. having a good knowledge of the roles and responsiblities different actors play in the society helps me putting the little me into a big context. The best way I can make things work out for me is to detach my emotion from a situation, trying as much as possible to see everybody as a unique addition to my capacity. By ensuring everyone see the importance of their work, no matter how small, people perform at their optimum, and are ready to make sacrifice for the advancement of an objective

### Politics

My political persuasion is **Nigerian** :nigeria:, if there's any such thing. Meaning that politics in any form may never benefit the populace. I swing between the left and right when it's logically convenient. I'm not a charlatan though, and I'm not liberal or conservative as well. I just have an **Occam's Razor** that I carry around, I call it **Yelism**.

> A talent for following the ways of yesterday is not sufficient to improve the world today

### Bio 
> _Alex is a software developer who has been writing software applications for over a decade now.  He started as an enthusiast cutting his teeth in the Java programming ecosystem in the late 2000s. He wrote many software applications ranging from embedded systems to a JSP web application. He would later earn his laurels designing, developing and deploying enterprise wide applications on the J2EE platform using Java on the backend and Javascript for scripting on the frontend. In his quest to find better ways to write programs, he started using Scala. He has since then been using Scala to craft most of his applications. He believes Scala provides a balance between applicability and terseness. He also sometimes writes program in JavaScript and python._
