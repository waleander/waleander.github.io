 I'm Akinwale Alexander. A software developer, computer programmer, computer scientist. Enjoy writing software applications and designing solutions to problems organization face on a daily basis. Ever since I discovered the powers to be had from talking to computers, I have written code in many languages, from Java to OCaml to Assembly. Along the way I have gained mastery in using a few libraries and frameworks. I have learned the skill of designing systems, and understanding how other systems were architected. I have piggybacked on giants and luminaries who have continuously pushed the boundary of these fields through sheer ingenuity. I find the ability to harness these powers and to transform them into useful industry that can be of benefit to the world at large a great skill in and of itself. Programming from the onset had been an expression of love for computers and technology. I don't let anything erodes this feeling.

I'm enthusiastic about functional programming. My primary language is, but not limited to, Scala. I however understand that it would take some years for any drastic change to take place in the business world. Ergo, my OOAD techniques are still intact. Both can actually exist in the same codebase.

### My Motivation
I'm motivated by fear. I hate being scared to do something as long as it has a consensual benefit. 
No task is ever huge for me. I don't see myself as talented, I see myself as someone who excel at a ridiculously sickening work ethic. The separation of talent and skill is something that I always try to come to terms with. No matter how talented you are, your talent won't take you anywhere if you don't have skills. So I keep honing my skill, and I would rather people see it as talent than for the talent to atrophy or misused.

### Listening
Lately I have found a way to be nice to people And that was by honing my ability to listen more to people. Listening is not just about being silent, and just allowing the other person to do the talking while I hold on to my truth, it is about opening up your mind and accepting people's mental projection without making value judgement about their opinion.


### Debugging my brain
I wake up in the morning, turn up my laptop, put the fingers on the keyboard, and type the crap out of my brain before the start of the day. I do that without thinking too much about what I am putting down. I just let them all come out. There is a an unalloyed joy that comes with that when you have the opportunity to get things down without thinking it gives me the opportunity to put my brain in the stream of consciousness mode for a while.

### Microscale thinking
I call it "thinking strategically individually on the microscale" -- putting the little me into a big contex. The ability to remove yourself from a any situation that involves many actors, make a clone of yourself and envision your clone communicate and interact with other actors. How would I want my clone to act? What are my expectations of me? This has been one of the most useful tooling in my box, it helps me detach my emotions, and control my temperament when in many difficult social situations, in addition, the roles I play in the society, at work, among friends become less complex.

I used to be an optimist. Right now I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst by practicing optimism on the short term and pessimism on the short term. This mindset have helped me in triaging task going from the bleakest to the rosiest based on time required to achieve them.


I'm an introvert trying the best I can to meddle in other people's business.

I enjoy reading inspiring books, visiting exciting places to meet people with a different culture and persuasion.

My political persuasion is Nigerian. Meaning I swing between the left and right when it's logically convenient. I'm not a charlatan though, and I'm not liberal or conservative as well. I just have an Occam's Razor that I carry around, I call it Yelism.
