I'm Akinwale Alexander, I'm a **software developer**.

Some years back as a young kid in elementary school, my school had just procured a PC running on DOS, and Computer studies was the new entrant into the school curriculla. My lightbulb encounter with the widget came when I was taught to code a script that stored and retrieved my name from a computer.  I always looked forward to the computer class just so I could run my script, and see my name on the screen, It gave me a special feeling. I became fascinated with computers from then on.

Then as now, I'm intrigued by the limitless possibilities of not just writing codes but developing software applications that expands the limit of our world.
